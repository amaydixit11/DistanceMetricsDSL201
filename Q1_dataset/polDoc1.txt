Narendra Modi's Third Term and the Changing Political Landscape in India

Narendra Modi was reelected as India’s prime minister in June for a historic third term. However, for the first time in a decade, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not have the privilege of an absolute majority and will lead a coalition government marked by internal disagreements. This result has cast doubt on the previously perceived unwavering support for the BJP’s core ethos of Hindu nationalism, self-reliance, and economic growth.

As discussed in my recently published book, the BJP’s strategy over the past 15 years has included discrediting established intellectuals as irrelevant elites while building alternative forms of "credible" knowledge. For example, in the run-up to the 2009 national elections, the BJP created two think tanks—India Foundation and Vivekananda International Foundation—to make inroads into New Delhi’s elite, primarily left-liberal policy ecosystem. Although the BJP lost that election, it won by a landslide in 2014, and these think tanks provided personnel for many government positions.

Under Modi’s leadership, experts have been systematically replaced with loyalists by dismantling or co-opting advisory committees, universities, and research institutions. This approach has normalized ideas that might otherwise have appeared ideologically biased, as seen during the recent election cycle. In April, Modi claimed at a rally that the opposition Congress party wanted to distribute wealth to "infiltrators" who, according to him, are undeserving. This was widely interpreted as a reference to India’s Muslim minority. The stereotype of Muslims "stealing" from the welfare state was then reinforced by Modi's Economic Advisory Council, which published a questionable paper in May arguing that Muslim birth rates are rising faster than other demographics.

However, the BJP is not a monolith. Its core social identity and grassroots base are grounded in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist paramilitary organization. Despite this, the party has never defined itself by a uniform political or economic ideology. Modi and the BJP draw support from various groups across the political spectrum, requiring their communication and policies to balance technocratic efficiency with Hindu nationalism. Appointed experts have helped craft a narrative combining both.

In recent years, several government ministries have outsourced policy development and implementation to think tanks and global management consulting firms. Whether intentional or not, these firms have promoted the idea that India’s Hindu identity is synonymous with technological and managerial advancement. For instance, in 2019, the Modi government hired Ernst & Young (EY) to manage the Kumbh Mela, the world’s largest Hindu spiritual gathering. EY developed a temporary city in Uttar Pradesh with luxury tents, AI surveillance, and new transportation infrastructure. The practice of hiring consulting firms for such tasks is common in many countries, but in an ethno-nationalist state like India, it carries deep symbolism. It merges the Modi government’s vision of a technologically advanced "Digital India" with its Hindu identity.

The 2024 general election result was not a technical loss for the BJP, but it was perceived as such by many. The party lost significant seats in former strongholds, including Faizabad, where it fulfilled the Hindu right-wing's desire to build a temple on the site of a demolished mosque, and Banswara, where Modi delivered an Islamophobic speech. Data analysis is still ongoing to understand the reasons behind voting patterns, but it is evident that voters responded positively to the opposition's commitment to upholding constitutional principles and democratic representation.

It may be naive to think the 2024 election proves that the Indian public is less willing to support the Hindu nationalism legitimized by Modi’s government. After all, the BJP still won 240 out of 543 seats—a significant margin for a single party. However, it does indicate that there is still room for a plurality of political opinions in India’s universities, research organizations, and think tanks.
