Mr. Greedy, a beloved African penguin at the Maryland Zoo, has died at the age of 33 after experiencing an age-related decline in health. He was the oldest penguin in his colony, which is the largest in North America, and left behind an impressive legacy with 230 descendants across five generations. Mr. Greedy’s significant contribution to his endangered species highlights the importance of his life in the context of conservation efforts.

Known for his mischievous behavior, particularly his penchant for stealing nesting materials and food, Mr. Greedy earned his affectionate nickname. He was officially recognized as African penguin No. 821 but was more commonly known by visitors and staff as Mr. Greedy. Born in 1991, he had been a fixture at the Maryland Zoo since his arrival in 1992, forming a lifelong bond with his mate, Ms. Greedy (penguin No. 832). The pair, who had been together since 1994, became well-known to zoo visitors for their longevity and reproductive success.

The African penguin species, also known as Jackass Penguins due to their distinctive braying call, has seen a dramatic decline in population over the past two decades, with numbers dropping by 75 percent. This decline is largely due to the scarcity of prey fish like sardines and anchovies, exacerbated by climate change and overfishing. The Maryland Zoo has been involved in the African Penguin Species Survival Plan, which plays a crucial role in ensuring that breeding pairs like Mr. and Ms. Greedy contribute to the survival of the species.

At under two and a half feet tall, African penguins are native to the Southwestern coast of Africa and land near Cape Town, South Africa. Despite their small size, they are capable of diving more than 400 feet underwater and staying submerged for two to three minutes.

The zoo emphasized that Mr. Greedy’s descendants could be vital in future efforts to restore the African penguin population in the wild. His life serves as an example of the crucial role zoos and aquariums play in conservation, despite occasional criticism of keeping animals in captivity. Through his life, Mr. Greedy educated countless visitors about his species and contributed significantly to conservation efforts.

Following his death, attention has turned to Ms. Greedy, now the oldest penguin at the zoo. The zoo staff will monitor her closely and may consider finding her a new mate if she shows interest, though her bond with Mr. Greedy was notably strong.

Mr. Greedy’s legacy as a symbol of hope for his species continues, as his life and progeny play a vital part in the fight against the possible extinction of African penguins.
