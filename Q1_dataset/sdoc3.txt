In a late summer afternoon, a large SUV slowly navigates the Midtown Tunnel traffic, heading back to Manhattan from the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre, site of the U.S. Open. Inside, you sit next to one of the greatest minds in tennis, Andre Agassi, an eight-time Grand Slam champion who’s spent much of the past 14 years away from the public eye in Las Vegas. Now, he’s making a cautious reentry into the sport, and you’re eager to understand why.

Agassi is a man of deep thought and introspection, as reflected in his groundbreaking autobiography, *Open*, where he famously confessed his love-hate relationship with tennis. Sitting beside him, you can’t help but wonder what has brought him back to the public sphere after years of relative seclusion.

As the SUV slows to a crawl in traffic, Agassi speaks of the dual nature of sports—how they can teach valuable lessons but also inflict significant pain. This insight resonates deeply, especially coming from someone who has experienced both the heights of athletic glory and the depths of personal struggle. Agassi’s career was marked by visible emotions, from joy to frustration, often mirrored in his expressive eyes. Those eyes, now focused on you, are still as sharp and contemplative as ever, probing into the depths of every topic discussed.

Agassi’s remarkable hand-eye coordination, which allowed him to read and react to his opponents’ shots with uncanny precision, was one of his greatest assets on the court. His ability to decode Boris Becker’s serve, by noticing a subtle tell in Becker’s tongue movement, is just one example of how Agassi’s mind worked several steps ahead of others. This analytical approach to the game has always set him apart.

The conversation shifts to Agassi’s unexpected return to the tennis world. His reappearance came without much fanfare, first noticed in commercials during the Australian Open. This resurgence was partly inspired by a reconnection with fellow former player Justin Gimelstob, who sought Agassi’s advice on youth baseball, leading to a renewed friendship and discussions about potential opportunities in tennis and beyond.

Agassi’s new ventures include a deal with Uber, a deep dive into the growing sport of pickleball, and ongoing talks about turning *Open* into a film or documentary. He’s also set to succeed John McEnroe as the captain of Team World in the Laver Cup from 2025. This role, he explains, offers him a unique opportunity to connect with the current generation of top players, sharing the hard-earned wisdom he’s gathered over his career.

As the SUV passes through the industrial landscape of western Queens, Agassi begins to unravel the evolution of tennis over the past two decades. He reflects on the introduction of polyester strings in the late 1990s, which allowed players to generate more spin and take bigger swings, fundamentally changing the game’s dynamics. This development favored taller players with longer arms, who could cover more ground and deliver powerful shots from deeper in the court.

Agassi explains the critical milliseconds before and after a tennis ball reaches its apex, a moment when the ball’s energy changes and when the decision on how to strike it must be made. This understanding of tennis physics was something Agassi mastered over years of play, allowing him to dominate opponents with well-timed, powerful shots.

However, Agassi acknowledges that today’s players, who instinctively strike the ball after its apex, miss out on the nuances that he once exploited to gain an edge. When working with players like Novak Djokovic or up-and-coming juniors, Agassi focuses on teaching them to recognize these moments and decide how to best use them to their advantage.

The SUV eventually reaches Manhattan, where Agassi is set to continue his reentry into the public tennis sphere. As the car nears his midtown hotel, he reflects on the nature of tennis and the psychological toll it takes on those who play it. He understands the pressure that comes with the sport, not just from opponents but from within. Agassi reveals that his greatest fear was never losing but the possibility of self-sabotage, of giving up when the going got tough.

This introspection extends to his observations about tennis parents and their impact on their children. He warns that even well-meaning encouragement after a win can inadvertently place undue pressure on young players, shaping their perceptions of love and success in ways that can be damaging.

As the conversation winds down, Agassi talks about the modern game and the players who often play out of fear. He recognizes the telltale signs of those who, like him, wrestle with the fear of quitting or not living up to their potential. It’s a struggle familiar to any tortured perfectionist, a battle between pushing oneself to the limit without going over the edge.

Just before he steps out of the SUV, Agassi reflects on his exhibition match with Carlos Alcaraz and John McEnroe, joking about the physical demands of the game. Yet, when he speaks of Alcaraz, there’s a hint of admiration and understanding, as if he sees in the young Spaniard a kindred spirit navigating the same emotional terrain he once did.

As Agassi disappears into the Manhattan crowd, you’re left contemplating the depth of his insights and the contradictions at the heart of tennis. It’s a sport that demands everything from those who play it, a constant battle with oneself, even as it’s measured against others. Agassi’s return to the game feels like a full circle—a journey of a man who has found peace with the sport that both shaped and challenged him.
