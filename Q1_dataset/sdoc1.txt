The story of San Marino's men’s soccer team is a tale of perseverance, resilience, and an unlikely triumph that took nearly two decades to materialize. As the lowest-ranked team in the world, San Marino has faced more defeats than victories, with a record that often sees them at the receiving end of lopsided scores. But on a recent Thursday, the narrative changed when San Marino clinched a historic 1-0 victory over Liechtenstein, marking their first competitive win since 2004.

San Marino’s position at the bottom of the FIFA world rankings is well-known among soccer enthusiasts. With a population of only about 30,000 people and an area roughly the size of Manhattan, San Marino is dwarfed by the giants of the sport, such as Argentina, France, and Spain. The country’s small size has always been a significant challenge, making it difficult to field competitive teams in international sports.

For years, San Marino’s soccer team had been the epitome of underdog struggles. Since beginning official competitive play in 1990, the team had never won a game in an official competition. Their only win prior to this year was in a friendly match in 2004. Each match brought the promise of yet another loss, sometimes by staggering margins, such as their 10-0 defeat to England or 7-1 loss to Poland during World Cup qualifiers.

But this week’s victory over Liechtenstein was different. It was not just another match; it was a symbol of hope and determination for a team that had been accustomed to losing. The match, played in San Marino in front of fewer than 1,000 fans, ended in a 1-0 victory, thanks to a goal by 19-year-old midfielder Nicko Sensoli. Sensoli, who wasn’t even born the last time San Marino won, expressed his elation after the game, saying, “I’m over the moon. To win at home in front of your family and fans is just something that is priceless.”

The emotional weight of the win was palpable among the players and fans alike. Dante Rossi, a 37-year-old defender for San Marino, who had never before experienced a win at this level, struggled to find words to describe the feelings after the victory. “To beat Liechtenstein has been an incredible joy. It is complicated to find the right words to describe the massive emotions we felt,” Rossi said. 

The scenes after the final whistle were a testament to the significance of the moment. Some players raised their arms in triumph, others embraced, while a few simply collapsed to the turf, overwhelmed by the magnitude of what they had achieved. The San Marino team had finally broken their long-standing losing streak, and in doing so, they gave their fans something to celebrate—a rarity in the team’s history.

San Marino’s soccer success is not limited to this one victory. The team’s participation in the UEFA Nations League, a competition designed to group teams according to their abilities, has provided them with more opportunities to compete on a level playing field. In this league, San Marino has been grouped with teams like Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, which gives them a better chance of winning compared to facing powerhouses in World Cup qualifiers.

Despite the historic win, San Marino’s journey has been filled with challenges. The team’s record in the three previous Nations Leagues was 0-12-2, a reflection of their struggles. However, the victory against Liechtenstein has sparked a new sense of belief within the team. Rossi admitted that the years of losing had been tough but emphasized the importance of continuing to believe in their abilities. “We’ve always aimed to win at least a game. We demonstrated that this is possible; we should keep on believing in our own abilities and seek for more performances like yesterday’s,” Rossi stated.

The challenges that San Marino faces in sports are not unique to soccer. The country’s small size and population have made it difficult to succeed in any international competition. For instance, San Marino does not compete internationally in women’s soccer, and at the Olympics, the country has struggled to make a mark. It wasn’t until the 2021 Tokyo Olympics that San Marino won its first-ever medals, two in shooting and one in wrestling. However, in the 2024 Paris Olympics, the country returned home without any medals, a reminder of the difficulties they face on the world stage.

Despite these challenges, the victory against Liechtenstein has provided a glimmer of hope for the future of San Marino’s soccer team. The team is now 1-0 in their Nations League group with three games to play. If they can maintain their momentum and finish ahead of Liechtenstein and Gibraltar, they will gain promotion from League D to League C. This would mean facing stronger teams like Estonia and Bulgaria, a challenge that the team seems eager to embrace.

Rossi, reflecting on the team’s recent performance, expressed confidence in their ability to compete against better teams. “I think we are experiencing a growth that even last year allowed us to face Denmark, Slovenia, and Finland almost at the same level,” he said. Although San Marino lost to those teams, the margins were narrower than expected, a sign that the team is improving. “I’m sure that we fully deserve to face such opponents: Football is 11 players facing 11 other players, and the best win,” Rossi added.

San Marino’s victory is a reminder that in sports, as in life, persistence can eventually lead to success. For years, the team has been the underdog, the team that everyone expected to lose. But with this win, they have shown that even the smallest of nations can achieve great things when they refuse to give up.

The impact of the victory extends beyond just the players and the fans. A fan group known as Brigata Mai 1 Gioia, which roughly translates to “Never a Joy Brigade,” posted on social media that “This day changes all our lives.” The group’s name reflects the long history of disappointment that San Marino’s soccer team has endured. Despite the victory, the group has no plans to change its name, a nod to the many years of struggle that have defined the team’s journey.

As San Marino looks ahead to the rest of their Nations League campaign, the targets are clear. Rossi emphasized the importance of staying grounded and continuing to work hard. “The targets are many,” he said. “Try to win another game in the Nations League and, why not, try to protect the first place in the standings. However, we have to keep our feet on the ground and work with the humbleness we’ve always had.”

San Marino’s victory is not just a win on the soccer field; it’s a victory for every underdog, for every team or individual who has faced seemingly insurmountable odds. It’s a reminder that success is not always measured by the number of wins, but by the determination to keep trying, no matter how many times you fall short. For San Marino, this victory is more than just a game—it’s a symbol of hope, a beacon for the future, and proof that dreams can come true, even for the smallest of nations.
